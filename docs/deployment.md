# Deployment and local development

## Local startup

1. Copy `env-template.txt` to `.env` and replace the local PostgreSQL password.
2. Run `docker compose up --build`.
3. Verify `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health` returns `200`, then `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/readiness` returns `200` after migrations finish.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Migrations are forward-only and recorded in `schema_migrations`; re-running the migration service is safe.

## Deployment controls

Production images must be digest-pinned, built from approved provenance, vulnerability-scanned, and run non-root with read-only filesystems, dropped capabilities, `no_new_privs`, resource limits, TLS at the ingress/proxy boundary, and default-deny network policy. The provided Kubernetes files are a foundation only: configure the database egress policy, TLS ingress, backup encryption, KMS references, and environment-specific registry credentials before deployment.

## Recovery

Backups must be encrypted and restoration rehearsed before production enablement. Restore into an isolated environment, run migrations, then verify health/readiness and an application smoke test. Do not treat a successful backup job as recovery evidence.
